In our last meeting you talked about Quarkus so and beceause i'm a curious person i used Quarkus instead of Spring boot


## Running the application in dev mode
mvn compile quarkus:dev 

## Swagger
http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/

## Health
http://localhost:8080/q/health

## Metrics
http://localhost:8080/q/metrics

## OpenAPI
http://localhost:8081/q/openapi?format=json




## Things to improve
- Validation 
- Exceptions Handling


## Things i didn't have time to finish
- All Unit tests cases ( i used some but as examples )
- All integration tests cases
- See if we can do BDD tests
